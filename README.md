# inkbird_pybbq
Attempting to use a raspberry pi to interface over bluetooth low energy (BLE) with an Inkbird IBT-6XS so we can log cook graphs and get a web interface. 

You will need to install bluez on the raspberry pi. I used the following resource as a guide while installing the latest version (5.9 as of 05/08/2020) https://www.argenox.com/library/bluetooth-low-energy/using-raspberry-pi-ble/
